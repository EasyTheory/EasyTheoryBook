\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove the following alternative version of the pumping lemma. Let $L$ be a regular language. 
	Then there is a pumping constant $p$ for $L$ such that for all $w \in L$ with $|w| = p$, for some way to write $w$ as $xyz$ with $|y| \ge 1$, it is the case that for all strings $\alpha \in \Sigma^\star$, $w\alpha \in L$ if and only if $xy^iz\alpha \in L$, for any $i \ge 0$.
	
%	\item Prove the following (yet another!) alternative version of the pumping lemma. Let $L$ be a regular language. 
%	Then there is a pumping constant $p$ for $L$ such that for all $w \in L$ with $|w| \ge p$, for some way to write $w$ as $xyz$ with $|y| \ge 1$, it is the case that for all strings $\alpha, \beta \in \Sigma^\star$, $\alpha x \beta \in L$ if and only if $\alpha xy^i \beta \in L$, for any $i \ge 0$.

%	\item Prove the following stronger version of the pumping lemma. Let $L$ be a regular language. Then there is a pumping constant $p$ for $L$ such that for all $w \in L$ with $|w| \ge p$, for \textit{every} way to write $w$ as $xyz$ with $|y| = p$, there is a way to write $y$ as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ with $|\beta| \ge 1$ such that $x\alpha\beta^i\gamma z \in L$ for all $i \ge 0$.
