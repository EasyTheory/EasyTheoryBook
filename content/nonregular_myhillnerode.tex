\chapter{Proving Languages Not Regular}

\section{Introduction + Motivation}

Suppose that we have a regular language $L$ and two strings $x, y$ such that $x \in L$, and $y \notin L$.
We can immediately notice that for any string $z$, it cannot be the case that $xz$ and $yz$ go to the same state.
Why? Look at any \DFA for $L$; reading $x$ leads to an accept state $a$, and $y$ leads to a non-accept state $na$.
Reading $z$ from $a$
Suppose (to the contrary) that $xz, yz \in L$.
