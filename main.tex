\section*{How to Use these Problems}
This is a core dump of problems to practice in theory of computation.
This should give you a good idea of the types of questions that we will ask on an exam.
This list intentionally includes a few questions that are too long or difficult for exam conditions.
The list of questions is divided up into 5 difficulties: \Level{1} through \Level{5}, where \Level{3} is the maximum difficulty that we would expect on an exam. They are interpreted to mean as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Level{1}: should be able to solve within 5 minutes.
	\item \Level{2}: should be able to solve in 10-15 minutes (or at least see the approach that quickly).
	\item \Level{3}: should be able to solve within 30 minutes (or at least see the approach that quickly).
	\item \Level{4}: a very hard homework problem, likely taking a few hours.
	\item \Level{5}: either an open problem, or requires many hours of deep thought.
\end{itemize}

Try to not solve every single one of these problems. 
Instead, try to pick a \emph{sample} set of problems that you think would be most beneficial.
For instance, it would be a terrible idea to only work on \Level{1} problems, or only on \Level{5} problems. 

Discussing solutions to these problems is very beneficial, but \emph{only if} you have made an honest attempt at solving them yourself.
If you're getting stuck on a particular problem, try to understand \textbf{why} you are getting stuck on those problems, and try to remedy where the approaches are not clear.
If you're missing points consistently on coursework, try to come back to these problems to see why you are missing them.
